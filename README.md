This is an interactive project made by Dhakshayan. A from 1st year CSE.
This showcases the usage HTML, CSS and JavaScript for an interactive and easy online booking of shows.
This project shows the various use cases of different HTML tags, CSS styles and JavaScript objects.
The Movie-Booking project consists mainly of 3 different webpages linked together by anchor tags:-
      i) Main Webpage: which acts as a mother ship for the other webpages. It contains the links to 2 other webapges and acts as a Home Screen.
      ii) Movie Booking Page: page where the client inputs the data related to booking a movie; like movie name, type of seats, payment method,etc.
      iii) Snacks Ordering Page:page where the client inputs the data related to ordering snacks; like name of snacks, payment method, contacts,etc.
JavaScript has been added to the project to give logic to it such as calculating the total amount and adding alert boxes to complete payment.
